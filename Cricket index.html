    <h1><center>Master Blaster Sachin Tendulkar</center></h1>
    <p>Sachin Ramesh Tendulkar born 24 April 1973is an Indian former international cricketer who captained the Indian national team. He is widely regarded as one of the greatest cricketers of all time,[5] and is the holder of several world records, including being the all-time highest run-scorer in both ODI and Test cricket, receiving the most player of the match awards in international cricket, and being the only batsman to score 100 international centuries. Tendulkar was a Member of Parliament, Rajya Sabha by presidential nomination from 2012 to 2018.</p>

        <p class="para">Tendulkar took up cricket at the age of eleven, made his Test match debut on 15 November 1989 against Pakistan in Karachi at the age of sixteen, and went on to represent Mumbai domestically and India internationally for over 24 years.In 2002, halfway through his career, Wisden ranked him the second-greatest Test batsman of all time, behind Don Bradman, and the second-greatest ODI batsman of all time, behind Viv Richards.The same year, Tendulkar was a part of the team that was one of the joint-winners of the 2002 ICC Champions Trophy. Later in his career, Tendulkar was part of the Indian team that won the 2011 Cricket World Cup, his first win in six World Cup appearances for India. He had previously been named "Player of the Tournament" at the 2003 World Cup.</p>
        
       <p> Tendulkar has received several awards from the government of India: the Arjuna Award (1994), the Khel Ratna Award (1997), the Padma Shri (1998), and the Padma Vibhushan (2008).After Tendulkar played his last match in November 2013, the Prime Minister's Office announced the decision to award him the Bharat Ratna, India's highest civilian award. He was the first sportsperson to receive the award and, as of 2024, is the youngest recipient. In 2010, Time included Tendulkar in its annual list of the most influential people in the world.Tendulkar was awarded the Sir Garfield Sobers Trophy for cricketer of the year at the 2010 International Cricket Council (ICC) Awards.</p>

<p>Legendary off-spinner Muttiah Muralitharan has claimed that, during his playing days, he had the intuition that Sachin Tendulkar had a ‘small weakness’ against off-spinners. Muralitharan, who in his 19-year-long international career had many a titanic battle with Sachin, claimed that he found the Indian batsman to always be ‘uncomfortable’ against off-spin, and asserted that, owing to that very reason, he had an edge over the right-hander.

    "I felt in my career, Sachin had a small weakness against off-spin. With leg-spin he smashes but off-spin somehow he had the difficulty because I got him out so many times. And lots of off-spinners also got him so many times, I have seen it,” Muralitharan said during an interaction with Aakash Chopra on ESPNCricinfo.</p>
    
   <p> "I don't know, I never spoke to him regarding this, that why 'you aren't comfortable with off-spin.' I felt in my mind he had a little bit of weakness that's why I got a little bit of advantage compared to other players. Sachin is a difficult player, it's very hard to get him out."
    
    The legendary off-spinner, who is the highest wicket-taker in Test history, also revealed  while he preferred bowling to run-accumulators like Sachin, he dreaded coming up against batsmen of the Virender Sehwag mould. Muralitharan, in his career, was at the receiving end of many a Sehwag assault, including a 293 in Mumbai in 2009 where the Indian opener blasted a total of 47 boundaries during his 254-ball stay in the middle. </p>
